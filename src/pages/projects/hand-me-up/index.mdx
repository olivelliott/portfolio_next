A clothing re-sale application with a purpose that reduces the stigma of accepting low-cost clothing. Sellers list their clothing 
for sale at a rate that just covers shipping. Buyers can shop from a selection of low-cost but trendy and modern clothing. Buyers 
have the option to make an additional donation to a partner charity of their choice when making a purchase.

## Contributions

Initially worked in setting up back end technology and database with ExpressJS and Mongoose. Once the data connected
with the client side, I transitioned to assist front end styling and responsive design to meet MVP standards. I implemented
a color scheme and ensured that the theme carried across the pages. I moved to assisting a group member in creating the 
shopping cart functionality which proved to be a much longer process than we had originally thought it to be. I implemented
a global state so that the cart would function correctly before we reached the deadline.

This final group project of the UNC Bootcamp I attended showcases my ability to adapt to the needs of a project along
with my ability to manage group members in assigning tasks tailored to their strengths.

## User Story

### Seller
```
AS A wearer of modern clothing that is gently used,
I WANT to donate my clothing
SO THAT I can help lower-income families and individuals.
```
### Buyer
```
AS A lower-earning inidividual or family,
I WANT affordable clothing options that are modern and gently used
SO THAT my family and myself have adequate clothing that fits without 
the stigma of second-hand or low-quality clothing that will not last.
```
### Seller And Buyer
```
AS A buyer and seller of used clothing,
I WANT to donate my gently used clothing to people who need 
affordable options and still be able to shop on the same platform
SO THAT I can help lower-income familiar and individuals, 
and donate additional funds to support charities.
```
